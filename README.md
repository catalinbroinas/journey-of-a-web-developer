# My Journey in Web Development

This repository documents my journey as a web developer, starting from August 28, 2023. It includes detailed records of my weekly progress, tutorials, courses, quizzes, exercises, and projects. The information is structured by week, showcasing the main topics covered and the total days and hours worked.

## Overview

This project documents my journey as a web developer, including all the work, learning, and projects I have undertaken. The main focus is on continuously improving and expanding my skills in web development.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of this project [here](https://catalinbroinas.github.io/journey-of-a-web-developer/). Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome!

## Notes

- The first 55 weeks are based on the private project "My Biography," which served as the foundation for this project. More details can be found on the `old` branch.
- This version includes more comprehensive information than the previous one. The first 54 weeks have been reconstituted from the courses and projects I completed. As a result, the 'Concepts in depth' section may still lack detailed information or contain more general content, specifically for these weeks.

## Current Status

This is the beta version of this project. In the future, the project may take on a new format â€” more consistent, clearer, and containing more relevant information.

## Branches

- **`main`:** The current version of this project, updated every week.
- **`old`:** Contains the old version of this project, which was implemented as part of my private project "My Biography".

## Next Steps

- **Implementing new features and enhancing design**:
  * Continuously introduce features to provide deeper insights into my progress and refine the user interface for an improved experience.
- **Ongoing learning and integration of modern web development practices**:
  * Regularly update the project with weekly progress, highlighting newly acquired skills.
